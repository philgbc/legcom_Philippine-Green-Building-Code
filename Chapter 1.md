# CHAPTER I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

## Section 1. Title
This document shall be known as the “Philippine Green Building Code” hereinafter referred to as the “GB Code”.

## Section 2. Policy
The state shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature against harmful effects of climate change. It shall safeguard the environment, property, public health, in the interest of the common good and general welfare consistent with the principles of sound environmental management and control; and for this purpose, prescribe acceptable set of standards and requirements for relevant buildings to regulate their location, site, planning, design, quality of material, construction, use, occupancy, operation and maintenance.

## Section 3. Objectives
The GB Code seeks to improve the efficiency of building performance through a framework of acceptable set of standards that will enhance sound environmental and resource management that will counter the harmful gases responsible for the adverse effects of climate change, throughout the building’s life-cycle including efficient use of resources, site selection, planning, design, construction, use, occupancy, operation and maintenance, without significant increase in cost. This GB Code is a set of regulations setting minimum standards for compliance and not intended to rate buildings.

## Section 4. Principles

<dl>
  <dd>4.1&emsp;The technical professionals, developers, contractors, property managers and building owners involved in the planning, design, construction and management of buildings have the opportunity and responsibility to help government address the adverse effects of climate change by ensuring that buildings are planned, designed, constructed, operated and maintained to the required efficiency level.</dd>
  <dd>4.2&emsp;Resources must be used efficiently to equitably meet the developmental and environmental needs of the present and future generations.</dd>
  <dd>4.3&emsp;Occupants of green buildings will benefit from improved indoor environmental quality, which promotes higher productivity and better comfort.</dd>
</dl>

## Section 5. Definition of Terms
The words, terms and phrases as used in this GB Code shall have the meaning or definition as indicated in the National Building Code (NBC) and Annex 1.

## Section 6. Green Building Concept
Green building is the practice of adopting measures that promote resource management efficiency and site sustainability while minimizing the negative impact of buildings on human health and the environment. This practice complements the conventional building design concerns of economy, durability, serviceability and comfort.

## Section 7. Approach
The GB Code adopts a staggered or incremental approach and is subject to periodic review by the Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), through the National Building Code Development Office (NBCDO), to modify or include new aspects and emerging efficient technologies and expand the coverage to other building use / occupancy or replace outmoded measures.

## Section 8. Building Use / Occupancy Coverage and Application

<p>8.1&emsp;The provisions of the GB Code shall apply to all new construction and/or with alteration of buildings in the following classification with the required minimum Total Gross Floor Areas (TGFA) as indicated in Table 1 below:</p>
